                <strong>Conchita Wurst - Rise like a phoenix.</strong> "Rise Like a Phoenix" is a pop song performed by Austrian singer Conchita Wurst, and the winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 2014. "Rise Like a Phoenix" was Austria's second winning entry in the competition, their first being in 1966. <br>
                <br> Composer Ali Zuckowski had originally composed the song for another project, however, every major record label in Austria had refused to produce "Rise Like a Phoenix". Following a request from the Austrian Eurovision team about possible song contributions, Zuckowski immediately thought of suggesting "Rise Like a Phoenix", reasoning, "I knew that with this song still something great was going to happen".<br>
